"I felt supported as a mentor and the training offered in the OLS-3 was adequate, I enjoyed my participation and did not find the experience overwhelming, I found mentoring this project really inspiring.

I just need to think it through/discuss.","I remain very inspired by this work and continue to evolve my own knowledge, skills and practices in open science. Thank you for the opportunty to mentor in OLS3!"
"I felt supported as a mentor and the training offered in the OLS-3 was adequate, I enjoyed my participation and did not find the experience overwhelming","It was a very positive experience. The training for mentors at the beginning of the cohort was very good, it was very valuable in providing a framework for the mentoring relationship and tips for how to handle conversations. I also really enjoyed getting to meet other mentors.
 
The relationship with the mentees has been very good, I am happy I had an opportunity to meet a group whom I may not have come across otherwise. I think their project was slightly too large in scope, I tried to guide them around that while allowing them to shape their work (instead of trying to make the project look like what I may have done). The project has now taken a different line where they’ll pursue a collaboration with another group, I see it a very positive outcome even though it’s different from what they set out to do at the beginning. I am also planning to keep in touch with the mentees.

I felt supported as a mentor and the training offered in the OLS-3 was adequate,"The resources provided for mentors - from communication channels, through calls with other mentors, to hackmd templates for notetaking during calls - were all excellent. If there is something more that you can do to help us figure out the expectations mentees will have of mentors before they start the project (e.g. asking for more detail in their answers to the question on that point in the application form), I think that would have helped us. I felt that my mentees expected more hands-on input, on the technical side of the project, than I had intended to provide. Indeed, I had assumed at the start of the project that I would not have anything to offer them in terms of programming knowledge, that they did not already possess. In the end, I started giving them practical guidance, example code snippets, etc, to help them get unstuck with the project - perhaps shifting more into an ""expert"" role at that stage. But I think we found a balance that worked for us, so this was not really a problem in the end.

They were supposed to contact me every time they would like to talk because they could not set a fixed call due to their schedules, and for the final call to show me their presentation, they didn't. I am also not sure if they had a clear idea of what this program is, because they were not very active in contacting the people I put them in contact with."

I felt supported as a mentor and the training offered in the OLS-3 was adequate,"I think y'all have a great program and I enjoy what you offered to the mentors. 

Confidentially, I don't think that my mentee Jennifer and I clicked very well on a personal level and that meant that there didn't seem to be much that came of what we talked about in our mentorship meetings. There were a lot of really good reasons for us to be connected as mentor/mentee (great topic, qual research, approach to openness) but somehow our personalities made our calls feel unproductive to me and seem as though I wasn't able to offer much to her. 

Jennifer is clearly dedicated to the work and to making this open, and did a good job of pulling together her team and getting the work out there. I'm very glad that she was able to do that. I did my best to offer suggestions to support her but ultimately I got the sense that my suggestions weren't things she wanted to do - which is absolutely fine, but it felt a bit awkward to continue when it seemed like it wasn't helpful and we didn't have much more to talk about. It felt like our meetings were the same and didn't do much to support her. I did my best to listen and walk through what she needed and talk about her next steps, I'm hopeful that was of use to her, but it felt pretty insignificant. 

I don't think this means that anything needs to change in the program, I just think that sometimes the connection between two people can just kind of not work very well. I'm quite open if there's feedback about how I could have handled things differently, but ultimately I think there was a personality mismatch.
