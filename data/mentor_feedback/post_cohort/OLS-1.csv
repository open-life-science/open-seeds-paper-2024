I felt supported as a mentor and the training offered in the OLS-1 was adequate,"My expectations were to get to know other people interested in this kind of work, and to learn specifically from - and with - my mentee about these topics. Both of these things happened. My mentee and I struggled in our communication somewhat, I suspect because our cultural backgrounds were so very different. However, I am still very happy that we worked together. ",Mentoring calls were somewhat constructive,"Tooling and Roadmapping (open canvas, project vision etc.), Open agenda and social calls",Yes I'd like to return as a mentor,

Excited about the continued impact and community you are building. 
I felt supported as a mentor but the training offered in the OLS-1 can be improved,"it would have been helpful for me to chat more with the other mentors, even about practicalities of how to use the website, calendar, gitter, slack, docs, etc to make things streamlined for me. I was lost in the web of things, and didn't give this enough attention to get organised (that's on me!)

I felt distant - but it's been a tough time. In normal times & with more energy dedicated to this, I think what you have already would be enough!",Mentoring calls were mostly constructive,,"Yes, but I don't know how yet! Could be any of the three ways...",
"I felt supported as a mentor and the training offered in the OLS-1 was adequate, I enjoyed my participation and did not find the experience overwhelming","I felt quite well-matched with my mentees, in terms of the project they were working on and the kind of guidance they needed. I would have liked a clearer process through which to connect with an expert/experts and invite them to join a meeting with mentees. Maybe that info exists already somewhere already and i simply missed it.",Mentoring calls were mostly constructive,Ally skills,Yes I'd like to return as an expert,

"I missed out on some mentor trainings (due to scheduling conflicts, and my feeling comfortable from previous experience mentoring for MozOL), but the ones I attended were great! ","I think it was a great program -- speaking as a mentor where dealing with OLS is adjacent to my day job, I would ask for nudges in the direction of:
1. formatting and structuring in e-mails to call out deadlines and action items
2. converging on digital platforms for communications, and collating links through the website or a central google doc",Mentoring calls were always constructive,,I am not sure yet but ask me later,
