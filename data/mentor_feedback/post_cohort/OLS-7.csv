I enjoyed my participation and did not find the experience overwhelming,"I think Overall, the OLS7 program cohort was well organized as the previous editions. It's difficult to predict if the mentees will successfully be engaged and motivated till the end of the session. I think emphasizing the monitoring and evaluation of student progress could be a good approach to identifying early intervention strategies (more aggressive reminders and tracking mechanisms, to proactively identify struggling students and provide timely support to ensure their success.

I did not feel well integrated into the mentos community. I had a recurring calendar which did not have a link and asking last minutes was not a comfortable experience for me. 

Using Github was mainly the work of the mentee, however they would use some mentorship help on Github challenges, which I was a little short in.

Having been a project lead myself, I remember the orientation emails and the detailed instructions to help the project leads. I worry that my mentees might have had different expectations from the program and from my mentoring. Maybe it would be helpful for the mentees if there was a (mandatory or otherwise) check-in with the equivalent of HR at OLS. This is one approach I can think of, but maybe there is a better way to do this from OLS' side.
