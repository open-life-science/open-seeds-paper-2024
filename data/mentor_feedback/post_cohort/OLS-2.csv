How were your overall mentorship training and support experience in OLS?,What expectations from the OLS program were met and where can we do better?,How was your overall experience with the mentoring calls with your mentee?,"If you followed the cohort calls (notes or videos), which of the following topics introduced in these cohort calls were useful for you?","Would you be interested in returning to the next cohort as a mentor or expert, and/or join our steering committee?",Anything else you would like to share with us?
"I felt supported as a mentor and the training offered in the OLS-2 was adequate, I enjoyed my participation and did not find the experience overwhelming",,Mentoring calls were mostly constructive,"Tooling and Roadmapping (open canvas, project vision etc.), Licensing and Code of Conduct, Project development: Agile and iterative project management methods & Open Aspects, Knowledge Dissemination: open education, Preprints, open protocols",I would take a break but please keep me informed about the next cohort,"A suggested topic, which might have been covered under mental health day, and may only be a concern if you do community organization long term:

Keeping it real.

Community people *sell* community.  And it *has* to be a community we believe in.  We also have to be *authentic*.  But, some days we don't feel that enthusiasm as keenly as we do on most days.  How do we get through those tough days without misrepresenting ourselves?  

Can we do things, because they are great things to do, and still balance that with the knowledge this is a great idea *that will sell.*  

I think anyone who does this type of work for any period of time has to learn to walk the line between being authentic and being cynical.

Um, sorry, what was the question?  :-)  Thanks for listening, and for all your efforts.

"I felt supported as a mentor and the training offered in the OLS-2 was adequate, I enjoyed my participation and did not find the experience overwhelming","Y'all are amazing!! All the work you do makes the experience of mentoring so smooth.

I felt supported as a mentor and the training offered in the OLS-2 was adequate,"Most of my expectations were actually surpassed. The cohort calls were more informative than what I was expecting (I didn't participate in them personally because of time constrains, but watched them on youtube afterwards), the slack group was more amazing and supportive than what I was expecting, and I was not expecting a mentor training at all (thanks for the opportunity!). The only very tiny issue I had (but maybe totally my limitation) is the difficulty of keeping track of the hackmd or google docs files of each mentoring and cohort session.

"I felt supported as a mentor and the training offered in the OLS-2 was adequate, I enjoyed my participation and did not find the experience overwhelming, It would have been good to maybe have a reflection / consolidation session for mentors at the end of the programme but I really appreciated the training organised and the support from other mentors ","I think having a bit more structure and theming to the mentoring calls might have been useful, sometimes it was hard to keep them structured and ensure we were covering everything (this could also be me as a first-time mentor)",Mentoring calls were mostly constructive,"Tooling and Roadmapping (open canvas, project vision etc.), Licensing and Code of Conduct, GitHub and README files, Project development: Agile and iterative project management methods & Open Aspects, Knowledge Dissemination: open education, Preprints, open protocols, Applying FAIR principles, Designing for inclusion: Implicit bias, Diversity and Inclusion, Mountain of engagement and Community interactions, Persona and pathways and inviting contributions, Mental health, self care, personal ecology, Ally skills, Final presentation call (open and live streamed)",Yes I'd like to return as an expert,Thanks for having me as a mentor on this programme - it's been a brilliant experience and I've learnt so much!

I felt supported as a mentor and the training offered in the OLS-2 was adequate,"Overall, I really enjoyed the experience but since this was my first time mentoring, I don't have any other experiences to compare it to. I really enjoyed the mentoring workshop as I was able to learn a lot from it. 
I also liked how supportive and helpful the community is and I enjoyed listening to the stories and experiences from other mentors during our mentor check in call.

"I felt supported as a mentor and the training offered in the OLS-2 was adequate, I enjoyed my participation and did not find the experience overwhelming","I expected more engagement from my mentee in the OLS-2 cohort topics throughout the program, rather than specifically with the science of their project.

"I felt supported as a mentor and the training offered in the OLS-2 was adequate, I found the experience frustrating. I think that the mentees and I failed to clarify and describe what we expected from the relationship. My feeling through the whole program was that they were looking for a mentor who gave them specific knolwedge, ideas for solutions to their problems - while I wanted to be more of a coach, someone to listen and provide structure to their discussions.
