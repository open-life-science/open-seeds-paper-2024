"I felt supported as a mentor and the training offered in the OLS-4 was adequate, I enjoyed my participation and did not find the experience overwhelming",I really like having some initial training for mentors. It was really helpful and set the stage for my mentoring activities. It empowered me to provide my mentees the necessary support and at the same time set boundaries to make sure I don't feel overwhelmed and/or guilty of not supporting them sufficiently.,Mentoring calls were mostly constructive,"Final presentation rehearsals, Final presentation call (open and live streamed)",Yes I'd like to return as a mentor,I think they were able to engage most of the time. They often had to catch up between the calls and what they effectively used in their project.,Thanks. Awesome program and organizers!

I guess that's life :) Gill had a very busy time with teaching and the project changed focus in the middle of OLS so it was a bit more rough there. I think she managed to get at least something out of the programme but she has also been out of touch over christmas so I'm not sure if she's managing to graduate. I think in general people are just worn out over the pandemic: I myself was also not at my best in December and feel a bit more recharged right now. ,

One thing I would say is I had a few last minute invites to present that I missed - it would be good to know if I was on the line up for particular topics in advance so I'm better able to respond to requests when they come through. "

"I felt supported as a mentor and the training offered in the OLS-4 was adequate, I enjoyed my participation and did not find the experience overwhelming","My expectations that were met: I got to mentor an interesting person working on a cool project & watch both the person & project grow; I got to learn from other mentors and from the cohort; I had fun! Things to change (maybe): I have mixed feelings about how cohort calls are optional to attend. I like that it is flexible for the mentees (say, they can't attend a call because they have a work obligation), but I think that my mentee took advantage of that and ended up not attending most things. I think she would have gotten more out of it if she had to attend. Maybe a solution is that mentees get 2 free passes to skip 2 meetings (or something)? I tried to hold her accountable, but I think it would be more successful if it was in the official rules/protocols. But again, we are entering year 3 of COVID (someone I know called it ""sophomore year of COVID"" and now I have to call it that...) so having flexibility is really important.",Mentoring calls were mostly constructive,"Tooling and Roadmapping (open canvas, project vision etc.), Project development: Agile and iterative project management methods & Open Aspects, Citizen Science",I am not sure yet but ask me later,"No, they had difficulty engaging or attending calls","All the resources (notes, syllabus, videos, Slack) are so helpful and useful to me personally for various aspects of work.

"I felt supported as a mentor and the training offered in the OLS-4 was adequate, I enjoyed my participation and did not find the experience overwhelming","I enjoyed the interactions with the mentee and with other mentors. I think the peer support in both mentor and mentee groups is one of the strengths of the program.
The mentor training session is excellent.
The cohort calls cover a wide range of topics and are very informative -although I have to say I was not able to attend them in this program cycle.
",Mentoring calls were always constructive,,Yes I'd like to return as an expert,"I think she was able to engage but did not attend a number of cohort calls, My guess (but take this as my hypothesis) is that thai partly related to being busy, and partly to the nature of the project, which involved organizing an event and thus some of the topics of the cohort calls would not have been applicable.",

In this context, it may be useful to have an additional layer of filtering for future OLS projects."
I felt supported as a mentor and the training offered in the OLS-4 was adequate,"I greatly appreciate the openness and flexibility of this program (and forgiveness when other obligations get in the way) - so please keep up the great, welcoming work on that. But as a mentor I wondered if it was my, OLS organizers, or anyone's ""job"" to make sure a mentee was participating (my mentee ultimately ended up discontinuing). The cohort calls are not strictly required (and have a voluntary sign in), but after a few missed mentor-mentee meetings I found myself wondering if my mentee was participating in them as a way to gauge overall OLS-4 participation.",Mentoring calls were mostly constructive,Project development: Agile and iterative project management methods & Open Aspects,Yes I'd like to return as an expert,"No, they had difficulty engaging or attending calls",
