","Just a suggestion: while mentoring groups I would suggest prior to meeting the group, to meet 1:1 with each member to get a sense of who they are out of group dynamics. For instance men in a group tend to be more outspoken and can overshadow other members specially if it's a smaller group of only 2 people.

"I felt supported as a mentor and the training offered in the OLS-6 was adequate, I enjoyed my participation and did not find the experience overwhelming","I felt supported as a mentor throughout the program which made it very pleasant to do my job as a mentor. I have no real critique, but as my mentee unexpectedly struggled to work on their project/realized that meeting their goals would require to work the project full-time for a couple of weeks, it was not entirely clear how to make the best out of this situation. We had enough ""meta"" things to talk about (a lot of which related to the question of what it would actually take to achieve the projects' goals), so we didn't run out of topics at all, but I retrospectively thought that it would still have been good to have a few suggestions from OLS' side on what one could do in such cases. (E. g., one thing we wondered about was whether it would still make sense to present something at the OLS graduation - while I thought that it might be valuable to share their journey, my mentee felt slightly uncomfortable to give a presentation without being able to put any checkmarks behind the projects' goals.) Obviously, I did not ask anyone from OLS on that matter (which I am totally sure I could have done without any problems, and I would have gotten a supportive, suitable answer!).",Mentoring calls were always constructive,,Yes I'd like to return as an expert,"No, they had difficulty engaging or attending calls",
"I felt supported as a mentor but the training offered in the OLS-6 can be improved, I enjoyed my participation and did not find the experience overwhelming","I guess all the events OLS organizes like the coworking ones and the teaching ones are absolutely great. Aman made big chunks of his progress while attending to these.
Something to improve to the mentees would be a better system where we can connect them to experts. Aman really benefited from going to a Turing Way's workshop where he met people that were doing exactly the same kind of technical work that he needed. Maybe it was a lack on my side to not be able to come up with a mentor for him, but it's harder to imagine these things when you're by yourself. So, some kind of networking, connection, between mentors would be helpful for this.",Mentoring calls were always constructive,,No I would not be able to return,"Yes, they were able to engage",
