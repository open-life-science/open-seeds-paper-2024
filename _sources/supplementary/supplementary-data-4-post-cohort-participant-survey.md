## If you struggled to participate in the cohort for any reason, would you prefer to defer your graduation and participate in next cohort as well?

We're asking this to get an idea of numbers since we noted a little drop-off in a few OLS-6 projects. We're not 100% sure why but thought it might be due to pandemic-related fatigue, burnout, or illness, so we're exploring what options we can offer. Any info you can provide would be handy, and if you answer "yes" we'll be in further contact to see how we can help out.
